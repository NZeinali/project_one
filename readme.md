# WA traffic accidents

## TO-DO/EXPLORE >> This is just to explore the pattern/relationship between variable to see what is happening (the overall picture) after that we can hypothesis/test these relationships and weather they have a significant impact on accidents 

# How to round/Lat-lon to narrow down traffic zones (at the moment round to 1)

# Explore the relationships between the roads/suburb (lat/lon) and: 

    # Yearly pattern of accidents 

    # Pattern of accident by season/months 

    # Patterns of accident by day/night 

## ^^ Try and do groupby.severity

# How the accidents are in relation to: 
    
    # Year (time series) 

    # Season/months 

    # Day/night 

#Vehicle type (motorcycle/truck/car - other vehicle) - this can also link to cause potentially

    # Day/night 

    # Season/month
    
    # Year 

# Idea, if we can incorporate a colour map
